This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle VHDL bug involving mismatched generics across different design units.  The bug arises from inconsistent definitions of generics affecting signal and port sizes. This results in unexpected behavior during simulation and/or synthesis. The solution provides a corrected version ensuring consistent generic usage across all instances and entities.
